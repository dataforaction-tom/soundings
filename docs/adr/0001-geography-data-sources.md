# ADR-0001: Geography data sources for the v1 spine

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-05-10
**Context:** Phase 0 of v1 — orchestration & capture (`docs/plans/2026-05-05-soundings-v1-phase-0-plan.md`).

## Decision

The geography spine is loaded once at deploy time from the **ONS Open Geography Portal** (OGP) and the **ONS Code History Database** (CHD). The exact endpoints we consume are pinned below so a layer URL going stale becomes a single-file change in this ADR + the loader, not a hunt through code.

## Generalisation level — choosing BUC vs BGC vs BFC

OGP publishes each boundary at four generalisation levels:

- **BFC** — Full resolution, clipped to the coastline.
- **BFE** — Full resolution, extended to mean low water.
- **BGC** — Generalised, clipped to the coastline.
- **BSC** — Super-generalised, clipped to the coastline.
- **BUC** — Ultra-generalised, clipped to the coastline. ~6kb per polygon.

The plan asked for **BUC** everywhere because it is the smallest and we only need outlines for web display. **In practice, BUC is not published for every layer.** Where it is, we use it. Where it isn't, the fallback order is `BSC → BGC → BFC` — i.e. take the smallest available variant.

## Layers consumed

All Feature Services live on `services1.arcgis.com/ESMARspQHYMw9BZ9` unless otherwise noted. Each item below pairs a human-readable OGP page with the FeatureServer endpoint. Items marked `(unverified)` should be checked at first run and fixed here if they 404.

### Lookups

These are the join tables that drive `place_hierarchy`. CSVs hosted on OGP; we read them via the same arcgis service backend that powers the OGP item page.

| Lookup | Edition | OGP page |
|---|---|---|
| Postcode → OA → LSOA → MSOA → LAD | February 2025 | [link](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/80592949bebd4390b2cbe29159a75ef4) |
| Westminster Constituency → LTLA | July 2024 | [link](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/6f2f35a9a0b94e7e949eeba7785911d4) |
| Ward → LTLA → UTLA → Westminster Constituency | July 2024 | [link](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/maps/ons::ward-to-westminster-parliamentary-constituency-to-lad-to-utla-july-2024-lookup-in-uk) |

The loader (`server/soundings/adapters/ons_geography/hierarchy_loader.py`, Task 23) extracts the LSOA→MSOA→LTLA columns from the postcode lookup and ignores the postcode/OA columns.

### Code History Database

| Source | Format | URL |
|---|---|---|
| ONS Code History Database (CHD), area changes | Bulk download (zip, MS Access + CSV inside) | <https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/geographicalproducts/namescodesandlookups/codehistorydatabasechd> |

The CHD is **not** an ArcGIS service — it's a periodic bulk drop. The loader downloads the zip, extracts `ChangeHistory.csv`, and upserts into `geography.code_change`. Refresh cadence: quarterly.

## Why BUC where available, fallback otherwise

- We only render outlines on the v1 UI; sub-100m geometric accuracy is irrelevant.
- Mac-mini storage budget for the geography spine is ~3GB. BFC for every LSOA blows that.
- For levels where BUC isn't published (LSOA 2021, MSOA 2021, Region, Country, Ward 2024), the next-smallest is small enough that the budget still holds.

## What changes if a URL goes stale

1. Update the row in this ADR.
2. Update the corresponding constant in `server/soundings/adapters/ons_geography/endpoints.py` (introduced in Task 22).
3. Re-run `make seed` (or `make seed-light` for dev). Loaders are idempotent.

## Open items

- The `(unverified)` URLs in the table above should be confirmed against the live OGP at first loader run. If a service name has changed, update both the ADR and the endpoints file.
- Scotland and Northern Ireland boundaries are not loaded at v1. The data spec (`docs/v1-orchestration-and-capture.md` §11) documents this gap.
