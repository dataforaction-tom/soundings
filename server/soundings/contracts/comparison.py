"""Comparison + ComparisonValue — response shape for `compare_places`.

Per spec §4.4. `methodology_note` and `caveats` are present on every
other indicator-bearing response (IndicatorValue, get_indicators); the
spec doesn't list them on `compare_places`, but the symmetry is
deliberate — downstream consumers (UI, narrative briefs) treat all
indicator outputs uniformly. Phase 3 plan Task 3 documents this as a
spec extension.
