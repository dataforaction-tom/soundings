"""detect_insights tool — pure-SQL deterministic insight detector.

Surfaces three deterministic signal types for a single place:

1. **extreme_percentile** — the place's indicator value sits at the extreme
   tail of its same-type peer distribution (PERCENT_RANK). Severity is
   ``extreme`` for the outer 5% (<=5 or >=95) and ``notable`` for the outer
   10% (<=10 or >=90).

2. **peer_divergence** — the place's indicator value is more than one
   population standard deviation from the same-type-peer median
   (PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) + STDDEV_POP).

3. **trend_reversal** — the latest trend point's slope sign differs from
   the prior 3-point average slope (requires >=5 trend points).

All detection is done in pure SQL against ``data.indicator_value`` and
``data.trend_point`` so the detector is deterministic and easy to audit.
