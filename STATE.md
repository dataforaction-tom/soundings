## Component Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Repo scaffolding (uv, Makefile, .env, Docker, CI) | ✅ Phase 0 | |
| Postgres + PostGIS in Docker Compose | ✅ Phase 0 | Ports 5433/8001. |
| Five-schema Postgres + restricted role | ✅ Phase 0 | |
| Indicator + source catalogue (`catalogue/*.yaml`) | ✅ Phase 0 | |
| FastAPI app + `/healthz` + lifespan catalogue load | ✅ Phase 0 | |
| `ons.geography` loaders (places, hierarchy, geometries, code change) | ✅ Phase 0 | OGP URLs partly unverified — nightly live tests confirm. |
| `postcodes.io` adapter | ✅ Phase 0 | |
| GeographyService | ✅ Phase 0 | |
| Loader + passthrough adapter contracts | ✅ Phase 1 | |
| `NomisClient` + ons.mid_year_estimates + ons.census2021 adapters | ✅ Phase 1 | `population.total` + `population.households.lone_parent_share` verified live; rest plausible. |
| `mhclg.imd2025` + `mhclg.imd2019` adapters | ✅ Phase 1 | Both editions verified live 2026-05-11. |
| `IndicatorOrchestrator.fetch` (concurrent fan-out + level enforcement + dedup) | ✅ Phase 1 | |
| Three Phase 1 tools (`find_place`, `get_indicators`, `get_place_profile`) | ✅ Phase 1 | |
| HTTP + MCP transports for the Phase 1 tools | ✅ Phase 1 | Mounted at `/v1/tools/*` and `/mcp`. |
| Capture pipeline (6 sanitisation rules) + replay + alerts + corpus publish | ✅ Phase 2 | |
| Astro UI (`/`, `/place/[id]`, `/about`) | ✅ Phase 2 | SSR everywhere. |
| **`OhidFingertipsAdapter`** | ✅ Phase 3 (Block B) | Live test green for Stockton female LE. |
| **`DwpStatXploreAdapter`** | ✅ Phase 3 (Block C) | Code shipped; live test skips without `STATXPLORE_API_KEY`. Cube IDs plausible-but-unverified. |
| **`DfeExploreAdapter`** | ✅ Phase 3 (Block D) | FSM UUID real; KS4 + persistent absence placeholders. Live test fails-closed by design. |
| **`PoliceUkAdapter`** | ✅ Phase 3 (Block E) | Centroid + rolling 12-month aggregation. METHODOLOGY_CAVEAT asserted verbatim. Live test green for Stockton recorded crime. |
| **`OnsApsAdapter`** | ✅ Phase 3 (Block F) | Reuses NomisClient; employment_rate verified live (NM_17_5 variable 45, measure 20599); other mapped indicators (unemployment, median pay, affordability) still plausible-but-unverified. |
| **`IndicatorOrchestrator.compare_places`** | ✅ Phase 3 (Block G) | Ranks against full peer universe; loader = SELECT, passthrough = fan-out with 200-budget caveat; supports percentile / rank / absolute / rate. |
| **`IndicatorOrchestrator.get_trend`** | ✅ Phase 3 (Block H) | Loader = SELECT from `data.trend_point`, passthrough = `adapter.fetch_trend`. `series_break:` prefix partitions catalogue caveats into `Trend.breaks_in_series`. |
| **`compare_places` + `get_trend` tools** | ✅ Phase 3 (Block G + H) | HTTP `/v1/tools/{compare_places,get_trend}` + FastMCP registrations; e2e via both transports. |
| **UI Observable Plot charts (linkedom polyfill)** | ✅ Phase 3 (Block I) | Sparklines per IndicatorCard on `/place/[id]`; `/compare` page with bar charts + percentile badges; `/about` updated. |
| **Phase 3 server e2e (`compare_places` + `get_trend` + Fingertips cache)** | ✅ Phase 3 (Block J) | Seeds 3 LTLAs + a Fingertips life-expectancy cache row, asserts ranked compare + ordered three-point trend. |
| **Browser smoke runbook** | ✅ Phase 3 (Block J) | `docs/runbook-phase-3-smoke.md` — gates the `v0.4.0-phase-3` tag. |
| **`v0.4.0-phase-3` tag** | ⏳ Phase 3 (Block J) | Pending browser smoke pass. |

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Postgres + PostGIS 16 | Working | Containerised. |
| ONS Open Geography Portal | Probable | URLs pinned in ADR-0001; some unverified. |
| ONS Code History Database | Working | |
| ONS Nomis API | Working | MYE + Census + APS employment verified; other field codes plausible. |
| MHCLG IMD downloads | Working | 2025 (File 5) + 2019 (File 2). |
| postcodes.io | Working | |
| OHID Fingertips API | Working | Stockton female LE live test green. |
| DWP Stat-Xplore | Auth-gated | Code paths shipped; needs `STATXPLORE_API_KEY` for live verification. |
| DfE Explore Education Statistics | Working | FSM dataset confirmed; other UUIDs pending live discovery. |
| data.police.uk | Working | Stockton recorded crime live test green; no auth. |
| GitHub Actions | Configured | Unit + integration on every push; nightly live workflow runs the live-marked tests. |

## Known follow-ups (Phase 4 and beyond)

- **`data.trend_point` not yet populated by loader-mode adapters**: the
  table exists and `get_trend` reads from it, but MYE / Census / IMD
  loaders don't write to it yet — passthrough adapters provide the only
  populated trends in Phase 3 prod. Phase 4 should wire trend writes
  during the loader pass.
- **Production sanitisation pipeline missing rules**: app.py lifespan
  composes only StripDirectIdentifiers + NormaliseAskerPurpose +
  ValidateConsentLevel. The other three rules exist + are tested but not
  wired.
- **Vitest in CI**: GitHub Actions runs the Python suite only; `cd ui &&
  npm test` runs locally. Trivial workflow addition.
- **Playwright UI e2e**: deferred per the Phase 2 plan "best-effort"
  provision.
- **IMD 2025 deciles/ranks**: only Scores (File 5) loaded for 2025.
- **Census TS-table IDs**: indicators beyond `lone_parent_share` are
  plausible-but-untested.
- **Nomis APS pay + affordability codes**: live-discover the dataset +
  variable IDs next time these indicators are exercised.
- **Stat-Xplore cube IDs**: unblock by adding `STATXPLORE_API_KEY` to
  GitHub Secrets, then iterate.
- **DfE EES KS4 + persistent absence UUIDs**: live discovery via the
  EES dataset metadata endpoint.
- **Police.uk smokes for violence + ASB**: only `crime.recorded_crime_rate`
  has a live test.
- **Backblaze B2 publication push**: deferred per ADR-0004.
- **Permanent-orphan pending stubs cron**: ADR-0003 edge case.
- **Observable Plot CompareChart polish**: percentile labels are
  positioned with a fixed offset; could improve readability with a
  tooltip layer.
